User's manual

This is a single user app.  The user has an avatar, a list of todos and coins.   When user finishes todos on time, he/she earns coins, then the coins can be used to get avatar parts.  If the user has enough coins to get a certain avatar part, the user can change his/her avatar.  Some avatar part requires high amount of coins, when not enough coins to redeem it, the avatar part is locked -- user can see it but can't use it as its avatar.
